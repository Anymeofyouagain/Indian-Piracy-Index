## Lets start ! What is Piracy ?

**Any digital paid or free item/thing which one can get for free is piracy. The one who does is a PIRATE.** Without wasting anymore time lets start !

## DDL and filehosters ?

DDL stands for Direct Download links, provides easy to download any file over the internet, without any specific IP address. While filehosters can be paid or free to download but provide low download speeds and much much ads..
